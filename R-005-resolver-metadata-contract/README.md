# R-005: Resolver Metadata Contract

Validates that resolver packages declare valid **inputs**, **outputs**, **resolverName**, and **failure modes**.

This test ensures that static resolver contracts (e.g., `resolver.js`) are well-formed and align with O-lang’s governance model—enabling tooling, linting, and safe composition.
